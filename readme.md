# Lego List project

This app makes it easier to create a list from an xml file produced by bricklink. I was struggeling getting the items from the bricklink list in a good proper format, especially if you already have some parts. Therefore i created this app to make it a bit easier. 

Run in docker; you can use the docker compose file to run it:

```
docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```
